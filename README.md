# Electronic-Online-Voting-System-using-BlockChain-with-a-Decision-helper-feature
An electronic voting system using blockchain, a secure and robust system that ensures anonymity of the voter, transparency in the process, and robust functioning with a feature helping in the Decision-Making Process of the voter, portraying all useful information and statistics of the desired leader from his past rule.

# Usefulness?
An application that helps you to vote in spite of, your geographical absence in your constituency (including NRIs), makes counting on the Governmentâ€™s side easy since counting can be easily automated in the app, and reduces the hassle of the entire voting process!
In this system, blockchain will be used to transfer votes between two peers, the two peers being the voter and the candidate who receives the vote. Blockchain will be employed in mass electoral voting procedures in a more secure way without needing a central authority body. The online app will also reduce the common crimes related to electoral processes such as booth frigging, booth capturing, taking advantage of illiterate people, etc.
In addition, statistics and metrics such as - Crime Rate during his/her tenure, Infrastructure Development, Software Development, Creation of new jobs, Education Qualifications, Net Asset, Criminal records, Promises taken vs Promises kept, Progress Rate, etc - a full profile of the candidate standing for the election will be made available to facilitate an educated vote.

# Target Audience
This app is useful to the Indian Population at large, especially NRIs and residents living outside the constituency. Making the process online would greatly facilitate them.

# Solution Planned
In ideal conditions as occurs with paper ballot voting, information about whom the voter voted is kept secret. This information is not even known to the Election commission. This security aspect is very central to the electronic voting system. Using this system we ensure the anonymity of the voter. To maintain voting data confidentiality, Trusted Third Party (TTP) can be used. TTP acts as an agent between the voter and the Election Commission to authenticate the voter to vote during elections. Multi-Chain is used as a component in the working of this system.
Once TTP authorizes voters to vote, the voter can choose whom he wants to vote for within his constituency. Each vote is conceptually equivalent to the asset in multi-chain and the transaction happens between voter and candidate. By restricting the multi-chain asset to a process maximum of one transaction between parties, the system is capable of restricting either multiple votes sent to the same candidate or voting for multiple contenders.

Other planned features include:
A reminder notification will be automatically sent to all the registered voters (including NRIs who live in different time zones) of a constituency before the voting ends to ensure maximum participation.
Choosing a regional language as your preference and the application will be translated into the chosen language, hence trying to cater to everyone.


Using this system, we plan to establish a workflow between authentication organization, trusted third party and multichain ledger.
